<p>Ecommerce has seen a boom in the last few years as the uptake of SaaS hosts has made it easier than ever to open an online store. If you are currently operating a separate brand, opening an ecommerce site as a side project can help you generate extra income. Plus, you don’t have to fork out for initial inventory costs if you use dropshipping.

For more established brands, the ecommerce model is increasingly becoming a primary profit-generating source. In these cases, investing in things like automated Facebook Messenger bots can prove to be a worthwhile investment in order to drive up revenue figures. </p>
